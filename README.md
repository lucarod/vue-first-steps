# vue-first-steps

## Why this project exists?

The intent of vue-first-steps is to act as a sort of study notebook for Vue.
Through the sections of this website, I've summarized most of Vue's learning docs and gave examples of usage of its core capabilities.

## How can I see the project?

The project is live on [https://lucarod.github.io/vue-first-steps](https://lucarod.github.io/vue-first-steps).
Some problems are expected, specially on the mobile version, where I've not been able to develop as intended due to not having enough time within the time interval (2 days)
